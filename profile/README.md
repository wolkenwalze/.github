# Wolkenwalze

Wolkenwalze is a workflow engine consisting of three main components:

* Core engine
* UI
* Plugins (including SDKs for Go and Python to write your own plugins)

It allows you to click and drag a workflow for your systems and feed the resulting data back into the UI for further analysis. You can also use it just to generate a workflow with parallel and subsequent tasks. There is a range of supported plugins, written either in Go or Python.
